# 2012-2023 NFL Points Model

## 
This is a project related to predicting NFL scores from large datasets over the course of eleven years of NFL game data, which found the top datapoints correlating to points scored are "plays ran" and "yards," which can be inferred from "yards per play".

###
**dataframe.csv** - raw data on nfl scoring by game

**line of best fit 3.py** - graphical representations of the dataset (both quadratic and polynomial regressions)

**entry 3.py** - float file for a sports handicapper to enter their prediction of offensive plays ran and yards gained for a team to model potential scoring (based on both quadratic and polynomial regressions)
